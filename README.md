Python-To-AQA-Psudocode
=======================

A simple hashed together converter written in python for converting python programs to AQA Computer Science Psudocode recommended syntax.

This was written initially for my own program so some parts may not work, please feel free to fork and make changes (and create pull requests)

It is very far from perfect but will work for simple to medium complexity programs

The initial Psudocode spec can be found here http://filestore.aqa.org.uk/subjects/AQA-GCSE-COMPSCI-W-TRB-PSEU.PDF
